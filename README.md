# Unity-MobileNative
This plugin allows Unity developers to easily access and manipulate various system settings that are not natively exposed through Unity's C# API. By leveraging native code (Java for Android and Swift/Objective-C for iOS), the plugin provides a seamless interface to handle system settings directly from Unity scripts.
